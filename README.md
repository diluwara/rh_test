# My Fullstack Project

This project consists of a Flask backend and a React frontend, both of which are containerized using Docker. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the application.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine. You can download Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).


## Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/my-fullstack-project/rh_test_db
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Backend Containers**

   Use Docker Compose to build and run the backend services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will start the PostgreSQL database and Flask application services.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/my-fullstack-project/rh-test-app
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Frontend Container**

   Use Docker Compose to build and run the frontend service:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will start the React application using Nginx.

## Accessing the Application

- **Frontend**: Once both the backend and frontend are running, open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the React application.

## Troubleshooting

- **Check Container Status**: Use `docker ps` to verify that all containers are running.
- **View Logs**: Use `docker-compose logs` to view logs for any service if you encounter issues.
- **Rebuild Containers**: If you make changes to the code and need to rebuild, use `docker-compose up --build`.

## Additional Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure any required environment variables are set in the `.env` files or `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Network Configuration**: Ensure that network settings allow for connections to `localhost` on the specified ports.

This README provides a quick guide to get the application up and running. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please consult the documentation or reach out for support.
